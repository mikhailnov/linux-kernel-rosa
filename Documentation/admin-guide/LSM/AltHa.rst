AltHa
====

AltHa is a Linux Security Module currently has three userspace hardening options:
    * ignore SUID and setcaps on binaries (with exceptions possible);
    * prevent running selected script interpreters in interactive mode;
    * disable open file unlinking in selected dirs.
    * enable kiosk mode


It is selectable at build-time with ``CONFIG_SECURITY_ALTHA``, and should be
enabled in runtime by command line option ``altha=1`` and configured
through sysctls in ``/proc/sys/kernel/altha``.

NoSUID
============
Modern Linux systems can be used with minimal (or even zero at least for OWL and ALT) usage of SUID programms, but in many cases in full-featured desktop or server systems there are plenty of them: uncounted and sometimes unnecessary. Privileged programms are always an attack surface, but mounting filesystems with ``nosuid`` flag doesn't provide enough granularity in SUID binaries management. This LSM module provides a single control point for all SUID and setcap binaries. When this submodule is enabled, SUID and setcap bits on all binaries except explicitly listed are system-wide ignored.

Sysctl parameters and defaults:

* ``kernel.altha.nosuid.enabled = 0``, set to 1 to enable
* ``kernel.altha.nosuid.exceptions =``, colon-separated list of enabled SUID and setcap binaries, for example: ``/bin/su:/usr/libexec/hasher-priv/hasher-priv``

RestrScript
============
There is a one way to hardening: prevent users from executing ther own arbitrary code. Traditionally it can be done setting on user-writable filesystems ``noexec`` flag. But modern script languages such as Python also can be used to write exploits or even load arbitary machine code via ``dlopen`` and users can start scripts from ``noexec`` filesystem starting interpreter directly.
Restrscript LSM submodule provides a way to restrict some programms to be executed directly, but allows to execute them as shebang handler.

Sysctl parameters and defaults:

* ``kernel.altha.rstrscript.enabled = 0``, set to 1 to enable
* ``kernel.altha.rstrscript.interpreters =``, colon-separated list of restricted interpreters for example: ``/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2:/usr/bin/python:/usr/bin/python3:/usr/bin/perl:/usr/bin/tclsh``. Symlinks are supported in both ways: you can set symlink to interpreter as exception and interpreter and all symlinks on it will be restricted.

Adding ld-linux into blocking list prevents running interpreters via ``ld-linux interpreter``.

Note: in this configuration all scripts starting with ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` will be blocked.

OLock
============
Unlink disabling for open files needed for Russian certification, but this is a nasty feature leading to DOS.

Sysctl parameters and defaults:

* ``kernel.altha.olock.enabled = 0``, set to 1 to enable
* ``kernel.altha.olock.dirs =``, colon-separated list of dirs, for example: ``/var/lib/something:/tmp/something``.

Kiosk
===========
Disable execution for everything and everyone (including system users
and root, if required) except given whitelists.

Kiosk interface uses generic netlink framework.
Interface name: ``altha``

Kiosk packet attributes::

        static struct nla_policy kiosk_attrs_policy[KIOSK_MAX_ATTR] = {
                [KIOSK_ACTION] = {
                        .type = NLA_S16,
                },
                [KIOSK_DATA] = {
                        .type = NLA_STRING,
                        .maxlen = MAX_DATA /* 1024 */
                },
        };

Possible kiosk modes::

        enum kiosk_mode {
                KIOSK_PERMISSIVE = 0, /* kiosk is disabled */
                KIOSK_NONSYSTEM,      /* kiosk is enabled for users with uid >= 500 */
                KIOSK_ALL,            /* kiosk is enabled for all users */
        };

In ``KIOSK_ALL`` mode root will be restricted if running from tty
Otherwise application will be executed anyway,
enabling the system to boot without garbage in whitelists.

Possible kiosk actions::

        enum altha_kiosk_action {
                KIOSK_SET_MODE = 0, /* set or get mode, see below */
                KIOSK_USERLIST_ADD, /* add app to user whitelist */
                KIOSK_USERLIST_DEL, /* remove app from user whitelist */
                KIOSK_SYSLIST_ADD,  /* add app to system whitelist */
                KIOSK_SYSLIST_DEL,  /* remove app from system whitelist */
                KIOSK_USER_LIST,    /* retrieve user whitelist, see below */
                KIOSK_SYSTEM_LIST,  /* retrieve system whitelist */
        };

``KIOSK_ACTION`` attribute is used.

``SET_MODE`` action will send current mode if ``KIOSK_DATA`` is empty.

When ``KIOSK_USER_LIST`` or ``KIOSK_SYSTEM_LIST`` action is requested, kernel sends
the first item from the list and waits for another request.
When end of list is reached, it sends an empty string and it will be safe
for client to request another list.

``LD_*`` cheats will not be applied when kiosk is activated.
